<p>
A hypothesis test is only as good as the sample used. A hypothesis test is not perfect. It tries to make the correct decision but when the difference between the null hypothesis and the truth are small it makes it hard for the hypothesis test to reach the correct conclusion. We can evaluate how well a specific hypothesis test will do under specified alternatives by investigating the power of the test. The power of the test is the ability of a hypothesis test to correctly reject a false null. For this investigation you will determine the power of the goodness of fit test to detect the companies not making fair dice.

<p>
On this page you will see the distribution of the dice produced by each company and you can clearly see that all but one company was producing fair dice. In this simulation you can select a company, choose a sample size to roll the dice with, and then repeat that roll a set number of times. The simulation will note each time the simulation runs the test statistic and plot it on the graph. In all instances the test should produce a test statistic that rejects the null hypothesis. The power which is calculated below the graph indicates the percent of times that the simulation correctly rejected the null hypothesis.

    Complete the following to investigate the power of this test:
</p>

<ol>

  <li> Dice R Us is a company that is close to being fair, what size sample is needed for the power to be near 90%?</li>
  <li> Dice Dice Baby is a company that is far from being fair, what size sample is needed for the power to be near 90%?</li>
  <li> For the two companies you just explored, how is the sample size related to the power of the test?</li>
  <li> How is the degree to which the truth varies from the null hypothesis related to the power of the test?</li>
  <li> Type II error is also presented. What is it's relation to power? Can you explain what a type II error is?</li>
  <li> Pips and Dots is a company that produced fair dice. Evaluate the power of the test for this company? Can you explain what you are seeing? </li>
