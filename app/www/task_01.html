<h2>Which companies make fair dice?</h2>
<h3>Task 1: Analysis</h1>

<p>
    Working with your partner(s), investigate whether the die sent to you by 
    the company is, in fact, fair. That is, are all six outcomes equally likely 
    to occur?  The following three questions should be answered through your 
    investigation:
</p>
 
<ol>
    <li> Would you recommend that dice be purchased from the company you investigated? </li>
    <li> What evidence do you have that the dice you tested are fair or unfair? </li>
    <li> Use your experimental results to estimate the theoretical probabilities of each outcome, 1-6, of the dice you tested. </li>        
</ol>
